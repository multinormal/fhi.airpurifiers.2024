`newpara'
All statistical analyses were performed as prespecified, except as noted, using Stata 18 (StataCorp LLC, 
College Station, Texas, USA). We had expected both sensors to measure the primary and secondary outcomes 
as counts, but the DigiRef sensor reported fractional counts. We therefore rounded these to integers. 
Negative binomial regression was selected over zero-inflated negative binomial and Poisson models 
for both the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of both outcomes on the basis of the Akaike information 
criterion and was therefore also used for the per-protocol (PP) analyses, which excluded measurements 
made when the air purifiers were not running as planned. All analyses accounted for the crossover design, 
sensor type, first-order autocorrelation (lagged outcomes), and clustering within classroom via cluster-robust 
standard errors. We used maximum pseudolikelihood in the ITT and PP analyses to estimate and hence account 
for undefined lagged outcomes (e.g., the first measurement of the day). Exposure was defined as the 
time between outcome measurements. Treatment effect was estimated as rate ratio (RR), where RR<1 
disfavors the reference treatment of no air purification.

`newpara'
We used partialing-out lasso Poisson regression (Stata's xpopoisson command) to perform 
a prespecified exploratory analysis to identify time-varying covariates that may be associated 
with the primary outcome and assess the sensitivity of the treatment effect estimates to these 
covariates. The lasso penalty was chosen using 10-fold cross-validation to select among the 
following covariates: indoor relative humidity; the school's existing ventilation system setting 
(low or high); weekday; baseline morning PM2.5 (modelled on the log scale); number of students 
attending class; and mean outdoor temperature. We had planned to include indoor temperature and 
indicators of undefined lagged PM2.5 but had to omit these due to nonconvergence. We had also 
planned to include indoor CO2 and sound level but had to omit these because many values were missing.

Finally, we tested for superiority of any versus no air purification, and for noninferiority of portable 
versus ceiling-mounted air purifiers using a prespecified margin of RR=1.4. We report two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals and use the conventional p<0.05 significance criterion throughout.

// Discussion
`heading'
putdocx text ("Discussion")

`newpara'
The results of the prespecified exploratory analysis should be interpreted cautiously because we 
were unable to account for undefined lags and could not include all time-varying covariates. 
Further, it was not possible to use a negative binomial model for this analysis, as was selected 
over the Poisson model on the basis of AIC in the main analyses, because Stata does not currently 
provide xpopoisson-like commands for negative binomial models.
