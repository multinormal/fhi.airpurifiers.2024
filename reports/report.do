`newpara'
We performed a prespecified exploratory analysis to identify time-varying covariates that 
may be associated with the primary outcome and assess the sensitivity of the treatment 
effect estimates to these covariates. We used partialing-out lasso Poisson regression (Stata's 
xpopoisson command) with the lasso penalty chosen using 10-fold cross-validation to 
select among the following covariates: indoor relative humidity; the school's existing ventilation 
system setting (low or high); weekday; baseline morning PM2.5 (modelled on the log scale); 
number of students attending class; and mean outdoor temperature. The model would not converge 
when we attempted to account for undefined lagged PM2.5 values, or if indoor temperature was 
included. We could not include indoor CO2 or sound level because a large number of values were 
missing for these variables.

`newpara'
The results of the prespecified exploratory analysis should be interpreted cautiously because we 
were unable to account for undefined lags and could not include all time-varying covariates. 
Further, it was not possible to use a negative binomial model for this analysis, as was selected 
over the Poisson model on the basis of AIC in the main analyses, because Stata does not currently 
provide xpopoisson-like commands for negative binomial models.
